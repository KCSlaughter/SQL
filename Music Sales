##In this project I downloaded a database storing 11 tables with information about music sales, employees, invoices, and more. 
I then used SQL to find out more information about the customer base, the sales, and the employees.

#1. Show all the customers (ID, Names, and Country) who do not live in the USA
SELECT CustomerID
, FirstName
, LastName
, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country != 'United States'
ORDER BY CustomerID;

#2. Show only customers from Germany (make sure you capture any entries where the country name  is misspelled).
SELECT * 
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country LIKE 'German%';

#3. Which invoices are related to these German customers? 
SELECT cust.CustomerID
, cust.FirstName
, cust.LastName
, cust.Country
, invoices.InvoiceID
FROM chinook.customers cust
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices invoices
ON cust.CustomerID = invoices.CustomerID
WHERE Country LIKE 'German%'
;

#4. How many invoices does each German customer have? 
SELECT cust.CustomerID
, cust.FirstName
, cust.LastName
, cust.Country
, COUNT(invoices.InvoiceID) AS no_of_invoices
FROM chinook.customers cust
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices invoices
ON cust.CustomerID = invoices.CustomerID
WHERE Country LIKE 'German%'
GROUP BY cust.FirstName
;

#5. Of these German customers, how much has each spent on average? Round the total to the nearest whole number.  
SELECT cust.CustomerID
, cust.FirstName
, cust.LastName
, cust.Country
, COUNT(invoices.InvoiceID) AS no_of_invoices
, ROUND(AVG(invoices.total)) AS avg_spent
FROM chinook.customers cust
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices invoices
ON cust.CustomerID = invoices.CustomerID
WHERE Country LIKE 'German%'
GROUP BY cust.FirstName
;

#6. Of all the customers in any country, who has spent the most?
SELECT cust.CustomerID
, cust.FirstName
, cust.LastName
, cust.Country
, COUNT(invoices.InvoiceID) AS no_of_invoices
, MAX(invoices.total)
FROM chinook.customers cust
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices invoices
ON cust.CustomerID = invoices.CustomerID
GROUP BY cust.FirstName
ORDER BY invoices.total desc
LIMIT 1
;

#7. Show a list of all customers' distinct countries. Order them alphabetically.
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM chinook.customers
ORDER BY country asc
;

#8. Show the price of each TrackID.
SELECT TrackID
, UnitPrice
FROM chinook.invoice_items
;

#9. What are the names of the tracks and their prices? 
SELECT tracks.Name
, items.UnitPrice
FROM chinook.invoice_items items
INNER JOIN chinook.tracks tracks 
ON items.trackid = tracks.trackid
ORDER BY tracks.name asc
;

#10. Show the name of the employee and their title and the total they have sold.
SELECT emps.FirstName
, emps.title
, SUM(invoices.Total) AS total_value_sold
FROM chinook.employees emps
INNER JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON emps.employeeid = cust.supportrepid
INNER JOIN chinook.invoices invoices
ON cust.customerid = invoices.customerid
GROUP by emps.firstname
;

#11. Show which person each employee role reports to
SELECT title
, reportsto
FROM chinook.employees
GROUP BY title
;
