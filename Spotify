# In this project I have queried from a large Spotify database to answer various questions about today's most popular music

#1. How many tracks did each performer record that reached a popularity score more than 89?
SELECT COUNT(track_name)
, artist_name
, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE popularity>89
GROUP BY artist_name;

#2. What are the names of those tracks?
SELECT track_name
, artist_name
, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE popularity>89
ORDER BY artist_name

#3. What are the top 20 most popular songs and their artists?
SELECT track_name
, artist_name
, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 20

#4. Divide the songs into cases describing three rankings of popularity
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity,
CASE WHEN popularity>90 THEN '1_popular' 
    WHEN popularity>80 THEN '2_liked'
    ELSE '3_unpopular'
END 'popularity_ranking'
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity_ranking asc; 

#5. What is the song with the slowest tempo?
SELECT MIN(tempo), artist_name, track_name
FROM Spotifydata
;
